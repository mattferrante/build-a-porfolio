## Build a Portfolio Website

This is project 2 for the first unit in the Full Stack Web Developer nano degree from Udacity.  I tried to recreate a portfolio website mockup as close as possible to the original. 

## What you should see

In the folder you should see, in addition to this file:

1. index.html
2. css (a file conatining css for the website)
3. img (a file containing images for the website)

## Browser configuration

Website will work best in Google Chrome or Internet Explorer

## How to view the site

Download the zip file of the branch master to your computer.  Once the file is downloaded you can access the website by double clicking on the "index.html" file.  It should open in your default web browser
